# Regulation Hub - Quick Start Guide

The Regulation Hub is now organized into clear sections to help you find what you need without overwhelming you.

---

## The Five Tabs

### 1. Overview (Default)

**When to use:** Any time you want to check what's happening right now.

**What's here:**
- Mental Model explanation card
- Current active signals (behavior patterns)
- Active preset (if you've applied one)
- Today's Daily Alignment status
- Safe Mode status

**Think of it as:** Your current state dashboard. No history, no analysis—just "what's present right now?"

---

### 2. Presets

**When to use:** You want support but don't want to configure individual settings.

**What's here:**
- Ready-to-use regulation configurations
- "When this helps" descriptions for each preset
- One-click apply (fully reversible)
- Clear preview of what will change

**Think of it as:** Pre-packaged support modes. Like switching your phone to Do Not Disturb, but for your work patterns.

**Common presets:**
- **Crunch Time** - Tighter signal sensitivities, fewer interruptions
- **Exploration Mode** - Looser boundaries, more flexibility
- **Recovery** - Gentle reminders, reduced pressure

---

### 3. Configure

**When to use:** You have specific preferences about signal thresholds or tool behaviors.

**What's here:**
- Signal calibration (adjust when patterns appear)
- Response configuration (create/edit support tools)
- Limits & control (set boundaries)
- Safe Mode toggle

**You probably don't need this tab.** Most people use Presets and never come here. This is for people who know exactly what they want to change.

**Think of it as:** The settings menu. Useful if you're a tinkerer, skippable if you're not.

---

### 4. Insights

**When to use:** You're curious about patterns over time, but not looking for instructions.

**What's here:**
- **Intent vs Reality** - What you planned vs what engaged
- **Attention Shape** - How focus moved (short/medium/long sessions)
- **Building vs Expanding** - Balance of adding vs completing
- **What Support Was Around** - When regulation tools were present

**This is NOT:**
- Performance tracking
- Productivity metrics
- A report card
- Instructions on what to do

**This IS:**
- Descriptive patterns
- Calm visual reflections
- Context for deciding if you want support
- Entirely optional and ignorable

**Key principle:** Nothing here means you're doing anything wrong. These are observations, not judgments.

---

### 5. Testing (Admin-Only)

**When to use:** You need to debug how regulation decisions are made.

**What's here:**
- Signal computation traces
- Context evaluation simulation
- Debug diagnostics

**This tab is hidden unless you're an admin or have Testing Mode enabled.**

**Important:** Testing Mode shows system behavior, NOT user performance. It's technical diagnostic information.

---

## Finding What You Need

### "I want to see what's happening right now"
→ **Overview tab**

### "I need help but don't know what settings to change"
→ **Presets tab**

### "I want to adjust a specific threshold"
→ **Configure tab** (but check Presets first)

### "I'm curious about patterns over time"
→ **Insights tab**

### "I need to debug signal computation"
→ **Testing tab** (admin-only)

---

## Understanding Insights

### The Orientation Card

At the top of the Insights tab, you'll see:

> "How things have been unfolding"
>
> These insights compare what you intended to do with what actually happened.
> They are descriptive, not evaluative. Nothing here means you're doing anything wrong.

**Legend:**
- 🟦 **Blue** = Intent (plans, alignment)
- 🟩 **Green** = Observation (what happened)
- ⚪ **Gray** = Context (signals, regulation state)

### Reading the Panels

Each insight panel:
- Uses **sentences**, not just numbers
- Shows **patterns**, not scores
- Avoids **judgment language**
- Includes **empty states** that feel reassuring

**Example good empty state:**
> No focus sessions yet. This panel shows patterns in session lengths and context switches. Try using Focus Mode to see how this works.

**What we DON'T say:**
- "You haven't started using this feature yet" ❌
- "Complete setup to see insights" ❌
- "Get started now!" ❌

## Language Changes You'll Notice

We've rewritten a lot of text to be more human and less clinical:

### Before → After

| Old | New | Why |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Analytics | Insights | Less cold, more reflective |
| Not reached today | Still open | Less judgmental |
| Missed blocks | Didn't come up today | Neutral framing |
| Imbalance | Leaned toward | Observation, not criticism |
| Context switches | How attention moved | Pattern-focused |

### The Philosophy

**Old way:**
- Metrics-first
- "Here's what you should do"
- Implied judgment
- Clinical tone

**New way:**
- Narrative-first
- "Here's what seems to have happened"
- Explicit non-judgment
- Human tone

---

## Empty States Are Okay

When you first start using Regulation, many panels will be empty. **That's normal and expected.**

### What You'll See

Instead of blank space or error messages, you'll see:

- Clear explanation of what the panel will show
- Reassurance that this is normal
- Optional suggestion for next step (no pressure)
- Encouraging tone

**Example:**
> There isn't much data here yet. That's normal—these insights become clearer as you use the app in real situations.

### What You Won't See

- Shame or urgency
- "Get started now!" calls to action
- Warnings about incomplete setup
- Feeling like you're behind

## For ADHD Users

This redesign specifically addresses common ADHD challenges:

### Reduced Cognitive Load
- **Tabs** instead of one long scroll
- **Progressive disclosure** (advanced features hidden)
- **Clear headings** that answer "What is this?"

### Non-Judgmental Language
- No "missed", "failed", "behind"
- Patterns described, not prescribed
- Explicit statements: "Nothing here means you're doing anything wrong"

### Visual Clarity
- Color coding for meaning (blue/green/gray)
- Icons that reinforce text
- Sufficient spacing
- High contrast

### Encouraging Empty States
- No pressure to "complete" anything
- Clear that sparse data is normal
- Optional next steps without urgency

---

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to use all five tabs?"

No. Most people spend 90% of their time in Overview and occasionally check Insights.

Presets are useful when you know you need support. Configure is optional. Testing is admin-only.

### "Will Insights judge my productivity?"

No. Insights are explicitly descriptive, not evaluative. The orientation card states clearly: "Nothing here means you're doing anything wrong."

### "What if all my panels are empty?"

That's normal and expected when you're new. Empty states explain what the panel will show and reassure you that this is fine.

### "Should I apply a preset?"

Only if you want to. Presets are shortcuts for common situations (crunch time, exploration, recovery). You can revert anytime.

### "Do I need to configure anything manually?"

Probably not. The system works with default settings. Configure tab exists for people who want granular control, but most users never go there.

### "What's the difference between Overview and Insights?"

- **Overview** = What's present right now (current state)
- **Insights** = What's been happening over time (patterns)

## Navigating Between Tabs

### Desktop

Click any tab name at the top of the Regulation section. The active tab is highlighted in blue.

### Keyboard

- **Tab** key moves between tabs
- **Enter** or **Space** activates a tab
- **Arrow keys** (optional) switch between tabs

### Remembering Your Place

The system doesn't remember which tab you were on between sessions. You'll always start on Overview.

**Future consideration:** We might add URL-based tab state so you can bookmark specific tabs or share links.

---

## What's Next

After getting familiar with the tabbed layout:

1. **Check Overview** whenever you want current status
2. **Explore Insights** when curious about patterns (no pressure)
3. **Try a Preset** if you're entering a specific work mode
4. **Ignore Configure** unless you have specific settings preferences
5. **Testing** is admin-only, so you likely won't see it

---

## Feedback

If something feels confusing, judgmental, or overwhelming:

- That's a bug in the design, not a problem with you
- The system should feel supportive, not surveilling
- Empty data should feel reassuring, not broken

The entire redesign is based on making Regulation feel like a supportive companion, not a productivity tracker.

## Quick Reference

| Tab | Purpose | When to Use |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| Overview | Current state | Anytime |
| Presets | Quick support | When you need help but don't want to configure |
| Configure | Granular control | When you have specific preferences (optional) |
| Insights | Pattern reflection | When curious about how things have unfolded |
| Testing | Debug system | Admin-only troubleshooting |

**Most common path:** Overview → Insights → Presets (if needed)

**Power user path:** Overview → Configure → Insights

**First-time path:** Overview (with onboarding) → Presets (to try it out) → Insights (later)
