Stage 3 Retrospective — Adaptive Interventions Layer

Status: Complete and sealed
Scope: Stage 3.0 → 3.5
Date: December 2024

Purpose of Stage 3

Stage 3 exists to answer a single hard question:

How can a system support intentional behavior change without becoming coercive, judgmental, addictive, or dystopian?

This layer introduces interventions, which are the highest-risk capability in any behavioral product. Interventions shape attention, choice, and action. Poorly designed, they create shame loops, compliance pressure, addiction, or silent control.

Stage 3 was designed not to avoid influence, but to make influence explicit, optional, user-authored, and reversible.

Core Design Principles

Stage 3 is governed by five non-negotiable principles:

1. User Autonomy Is Absolute

The system never decides what the user should do.

All interventions are created by users

All interventions default to OFF

The system never recommends, escalates, or auto-activates interventions

The user can pause, edit, or delete anything instantly

Result: The system assists agency; it never replaces it.

2. Influence Is Acknowledged, Not Denied

All technology shapes behavior. Pretending otherwise is dishonest.

Stage 3 makes influence:

Visible (Trigger Audit Panel)

Auditable (Why this would appear)

Optional (Manual invocation + opt-in triggers)

Bounded (Governance rules + Safe Mode)

Result: Users understand why something appears and retain full control.

3. Reversibility Over Commitment

No intervention should trap a user in a behavioral contract.

No streaks

No adherence tracking

No penalties for stopping

No “falling behind” framing

Safe Mode instantly pauses everything

Result: Stopping is neutral, not failure.

4. Neurodivergent Safety Is Architectural

Shame, perfectionism, fixation, and burnout are not UX bugs — they are structural risks.

Stage 3 explicitly forbids:

Gamification

Performance metrics

Escalating reminders

Compliance tracking

Comparison (self or others)

Result: The system cannot accidentally recreate harmful productivity dynamics.

5. Meta-Control Is More Important Than Power

Rather than adding “smarter” interventions, Stage 3 invests in governance.

Users can:

See all active interventions at once

Set personal limits (warnings only)

Define rules for when interventions are allowed

Pause everything with one action

Result: The system never grows louder than the user.

What Stage 3 Actually Does

Stage 3 provides tools, not outcomes.

It enables:

User-written reminders and prompts

Optional friction-reduction tools

Self-imposed constraints (focus, scope, timeboxing)

Gentle, consent-based accountability

It does not:

Optimize productivity

Judge performance

Enforce habits

Detect failure

Decide what matters

Stage 3 bridges awareness (Stage 2) and action — only when the user chooses to cross that bridge.

Architectural Safeguards Implemented

By the end of Stage 3.5, the system includes:

Manual-first delivery (Stage 3.2)

Foreground-only context triggers (Stage 3.3)

User-visible trigger audit & debugging (Stage 3.4)

Personal governance & limits (Stage 3.5)

Safe Mode as a hard override everywhere

Critically:

No telemetry

No effectiveness metrics

No engagement optimisation

No silent inference

This makes misuse structurally difficult, not just culturally discouraged.

Why Stage 3 Is Now Closed

Stage 3 is intentionally capped.

Adding more “delivery power” would:

Increase psychological risk

Blur the line between support and control

Create incentives for optimisation creep

Any future system that:

Detects distress

Evaluates impact

Intervenes for safety

Escalates to human support

must live outside Stage 3 as a separate, carefully bounded layer.

Stage 3 is about choice — not protection, not correction, not rescue.

Final Reflection

Most behavioral systems try to make people easier to manage.

Stage 3 was designed to do the opposite:

Make the system easier to escape

Make power visible

Make silence an option

Make stopping neutral

This layer does not ask:

“How do we get users to do more?”

It asks:

“How do we ensure the system never acts against the user’s values — even accidentally?”

That question shaped every constraint in Stage 3.
