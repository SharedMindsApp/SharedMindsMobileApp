/*
  # Fix Health Domain Project Type Example Text

  Updates example_text for all Health domain project types.
  This migration fixes any corrupted or missing example_text data.

  This migration will overwrite existing example_text for Health domain project types,
  ensuring they all have correct, valid JSON data.

  Safety:
  - Only updates Health domain project types (by name)
  - Only runs if example_text column exists
  - Can be run multiple times safely
