  2. Security (Row Level Security)
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Households: Users can view and update their own household
    - Members: Users can view all members in their household, update only their own profile
    - Sections & Questions: Readable by all authenticated users
    - Answers: Users can only read/write their own answers
    - Progress: Users can view progress of all household members, but only update their own
  
  3. Seed Data
    - 6 sections: Personal Profile, Household Responsibilities, Emotional Triggers & Stress, 
      Support Preferences, Perception Gaps, Household Expectations & Values
