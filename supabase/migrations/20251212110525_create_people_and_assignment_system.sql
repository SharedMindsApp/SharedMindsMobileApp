/*
  # People and Task Assignment System

  1. Overview
    - Introduces project-scoped People (not system users)
    - Enables many-to-many assignment of people to roadmap items
    - Purely informational - no permissions or access control
    - Analytics-ready for future workflow automation

  2. New Tables
    - `project_people`
      - Project-scoped people involved in projects
      - May or may not be system users
      - Supports name, email, role metadata
      - Soft-delete support via archived flag
    
    - `roadmap_item_assignees`
      - Many-to-many junction table
      - Links people to roadmap items
      - Tracks assignment timestamp for analytics

  3. Security
    - RLS enabled on both tables
    - Access controlled through project ownership
    - No invitation or authentication logic

  4. Important Notes
    - UI terminology: "People"
    - Domain model: project-scoped entities
    - Assignment is informational, not enforceable
    - No permissions implications
