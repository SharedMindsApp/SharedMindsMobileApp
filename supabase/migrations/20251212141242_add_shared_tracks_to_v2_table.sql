  # Add Shared Tracks Architecture to guardrails_tracks_v2

  ## Summary
  Applies the shared tracks architecture to the active unified tracks table (guardrails_tracks_v2).
  This is a corrective migration to ensure shared track support is on the correct table.

  ## Changes
  - Add is_shared, primary_owner_project_id, authority_mode to guardrails_tracks_v2
  - Update helper functions to work with v2 table
  - Create compatibility view for services
