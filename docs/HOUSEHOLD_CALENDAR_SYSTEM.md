## Common Issues & Solutions

### Events not showing
**Cause:** Not a household member or member status not 'accepted'
**Fix:** Check household_members table for user_id and status

### Can't edit event
**Cause:** Not the event creator and not a household admin
**Fix:** Check created_by and household role

### Drag not working
**Cause:** Browser doesn't support HTML5 drag API
**Fix:** Use click to edit instead, or update browser

### Times showing incorrectly
**Cause:** Timezone mismatch
**Fix:** All times stored as UTC in database, displayed in local time

### Widget not loading events
**Cause:** householdId not passed correctly
**Fix:** Check FridgeCanvas passes householdId to CalendarCanvasWidget
