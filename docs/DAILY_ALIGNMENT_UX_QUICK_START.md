## Planning Your Day

### Drag & Drop Work Items

1. **Find work** in the left picker panel (projects, tracks, tasks)
2. **Drag** to any hour in the calendar
3. **Choose duration**: 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, half day, or all day
4. Block appears in your schedule

### Time Tiling (Short Tasks)

When you add short tasks to an hour:
- **15 minutes** → takes 1/4 of the hour
- **30 minutes** → takes 1/2 of the hour
- **60 minutes** → takes the full hour

You'll see **segment bars** fill left-to-right showing how full each hour is.

### Multi-Hour Selection (Deep Work)

For big tasks spanning multiple hours:

1. **Click** first hour
2. **Shift+Click** additional hours
3. **Drag work item** to selection
4. Duration auto-calculated from selected hours

Or just:
1. **Drag** work item to an hour
2. **Select "Half day" or "All day"** duration

### Adding Microtasks (Optional)

Break down blocks into smaller steps:

1. **Click** block to expand
2. **Type** in "Add a step" field
3. **Press Enter** to add
4. Repeat for more steps

No requirement to add microtasks—they're just helpful when you need them.

## What This Is

Daily Alignment is a **loose planning tool** that helps you:
- Set a flexible intention for the day
- See your time realistically
- Feel good about completing things

## What This Isn't

Daily Alignment is **NOT**:
- A strict schedule to follow
- A tracking or monitoring tool
- A productivity metric system
- A source of pressure or judgment

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't drop work items?
- Make sure you're in Day view (not Week or Month)
- Check that hour isn't blocked time
- Try different hour

### Microtasks not saving?
- Press Enter or click Add button
- Check text isn't empty
- Reload if persistent

### Segmentation not showing?
- Add shorter duration blocks (15/30/60 min)
- Segments appear for partial hours
- Full hours don't need segmentation

### Roadmap button not working?
- Make sure you're in Guardrails section
- Check that active project is set
- Try refreshing page

## Philosophy

The Daily Alignment UX is designed around three principles:

1. **Reduce Friction**
   - Fast, intuitive interactions
   - Smart defaults
   - No unnecessary clicks

2. **Temporal Realism**
   - See actual available time
   - Natural time blocks
   - Visual feedback matches mental model

3. **Satisfying Follow-Through**
   - Completion feels good
   - Progress visible
   - No pressure or enforcement

**Result:** Planning a day feels faster, completing things feels better, and you can zoom out to wider context anytime.

## Questions?

Remember:
- **Nothing is binding** - adjust anytime
- **Microtasks are optional** - use when helpful
- **Views are flexible** - switch as needed
- **Context is accessible** - roadmap one click away

The goal is to make your day feel **manageable and satisfying**, not tracked and measured.
