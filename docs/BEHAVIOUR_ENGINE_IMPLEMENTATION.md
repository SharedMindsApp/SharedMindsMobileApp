# Behaviour Engine Implementation

## Overview

A complete Behaviour Engine has been implemented for SharedMind, including habit tracking, achievements, reminders, and full integration with the existing widget system.

## Database Schema

### Tables Created

1. **habits**
   - Stores household habits with scheduling and assignment
   - Supports daily, weekly, monthly, and custom repeat patterns
   - Links to goals for progress tracking
   - Supports multiple household member assignments

2. **habit_entries**
   - Records habit completions per user per date
   - Tracks streaks and consistency
   - Unique constraint ensures one entry per habit/user/date

3. **achievement_logs**
   - Stores achievement unlock events
   - Tracks streaks, milestones, goal progress
   - Links to habits and goals for context

4. **achievements_meta**
   - Defines 20+ available achievements
   - Categories: streaks, habits, goals, consistency, calendar
   - Pre-populated with default achievements including:
     - Streak achievements (3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 100 days)
     - Completion milestones (10, 25, 50, 100, 250)
     - Goal progress markers (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
     - Consistency badges (Perfect Day, Perfect Week)

5. **reminders**
   - Stores reminders generated from habits and manual entries
   - Links to habits for automatic completion
   - Supports assignment to multiple members
   - Tracks completion status

## Behaviour Loop Integration

The system implements a complete behaviour loop:

1. **Goals → Habits**
   - Habits can be linked to goals
   - Habit completion contributes to goal progress

2. **Habits → Daily Tasks**
   - Habits generate daily completion tasks
   - Tasks appear in Habit Tracker widget

3. **Tasks → Calendar**
   - Habits create calendar entries based on schedule
   - Calendar shows habit due dates

4. **Calendar → Reminders**
   - Reminders auto-generated from habits
   - Daily habits get morning reminders
   - Weekly habits get advance notice

5. **Users Complete → Habits**
   - User marks habit complete
   - Habit entry recorded in database

6. **Habit Completion → Goals**
   - Goal progress updated
   - Milestones checked

7. **Goals + Habits → Achievements**
   - Streak milestones checked (3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 100 days)
   - Completion milestones checked (10, 25, 50, 100, 250)
   - Perfect day/week achievements
   - Goal progress achievements

8. **Achievements → Motivation**
   - Achievements displayed in widget
   - Leaderboard creates friendly competition
   - Visual feedback encourages continuation

## Widget System Integration

### New Widget Types Added

- `achievements` - Achievement display and leaderboard

### Integration Points
- Added to `fridgeCanvasTypes.ts` WidgetType union
- Added content interfaces (HabitTrackerContent, AchievementsContent)
- Integrated into FridgeCanvas rendering
- Added to WidgetToolbox for creation
- Default content generation in `fridgeCanvas.ts`

## Achievement System

## Security (Row Level Security)

All tables have RLS enabled with proper policies:

**Habits:**
- Users can view habits in their household
- Users can create habits in their household
- Users can update/delete habits they created

**Habit Entries:**
- Users can view entries in their household
- Users can only create/update/delete their own entries

**Achievements:**
- Users can view achievements in their household
- System can create achievement logs

**Reminders:**
- Users can view reminders in their household
- Users can create reminders in their household
- Users can complete reminders assigned to them

## Performance Optimizations

- Indexed all foreign keys
- Indexed frequently queried columns (dates, completion status)
- Efficient streak calculation algorithm
- Batch loading for related data
- Real-time updates use Supabase subscriptions (ready for implementation)

## TypeScript Types

All types defined in `/src/lib/behaviourTypes.ts`:
- Habit interfaces with repeat patterns
- Achievement types and categories
- Streak information
- Habit statistics
- Completion results
- Reminder types

## Usage Example

### Creating a Habit

```typescript
const habit = await createHabit({
  household_id: 'uuid',
  title: 'Morning Exercise',
  description: '30 minutes of exercise',
  repeat_type: 'daily',
  assigned_to: ['user-id-1', 'user-id-2'],
  color: 'blue'
});
```

### Completing a Habit

```typescript
const result = await completeHabit(habitId, userId);
// Returns: {
//   success: true,
//   habit_entry: {...},
//   new_achievements: [...],
//   streak_info: { current_streak: 7, ... }
// }
```

### Checking Achievements

```typescript
const achievements = await getUserAchievementsWithMeta(userId, householdId);
const progress = await getAchievementProgress(userId, householdId);
// { unlocked: 5, total: 20, percentage: 25 }
```

## Future Enhancements

While the core system is complete, these features could be added:

1. **Habit Creation Modal** - Rich UI for creating/editing habits
2. **Calendar Deep Integration** - Display habits in calendar grid
3. **Goal Widget Updates** - Show connected habits in goal widgets
